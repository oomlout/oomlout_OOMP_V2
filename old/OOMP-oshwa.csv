The thumbstick is an analog joystick - more accurate and sensitive than just &#x27;directional&#x27; joysticks - with a &#x27;press in to select&#x27; button. Since it&#x27;s analog, you&#x27;ll need two analog reading pins on your microcontroller to determine X and Y. Having an extra digital input will let you read the switch.

PA000001,Alejandro Von Chong,Panama,,Low-cost, microcontroller-based phase shift measurement system for a wireless power transfer prototype,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5866775,,Seeking to characterize and mitigate the negative effects of misalignment in WPT applications, we present the design and construction of a low-cost wireless charger prototype and a novel phase-shift measurement system. The first is built using a half-bridge inverter and antennas with series-series compensation, while a microcontroller (Teensy 4.1) supplies high-frequency PWM signals. The measurement unit comprises high-speed operational amplifiers and an exclusive OR gate. A resistor was used as a load. As is well known, the maximum power transfer occurs at the resonance frequency, nevertheless, this depends physically on the geometry of the coupling system. Using a 3D-printed displacement system, we created controlled vertical misalignments between the coils, thereby obtaining variations in the resonance frequency of the system and consequently, producing a proportional phase shift between the voltage and current waves of the transmitting antenna. As the experimental results demonstrate, the measurement system is capable of processing and monitoring this high-frequency phase shift and subsequently used it as a control variable in a proportional-integral controller, which adjusts the operation frequency of the system and brings it back to optimal conditions. This precise yet inexpensive (USD 170) implementation could find its application in EVs and biomedical devices’ efficient wireless chargers.,Education,Magnetic coupling , misalignment , phase shift , resonance frequency , microcontroller , wireless power transfer ,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5866775,Other,MIT,Other,2022-01-21T00:00-05:00,

This improved amplifier is now suitable both for the use in introductory courses in biophysics and neurosciences at the undergraduate level and for scientific research. Similar to its predecessor, the OpenPicoAmp-100k is designed using the common lithographic printed circuit board fabrication process and off-the-shelf electronic components. It consists of the high-speed headstage, followed by voltage-gain amplifier with built-in 6-order Bessel filter. The amplifier has a bandwidth of 100 kHz in the presence of 100 pF input membrane capacitance and is capable of measuring ion channel current with amplitudes from sub-pA and up to ±4 nA. At the full bandwidth and with a 1 GΩ transimpedance gain, the amplifier shows 12 pArms noise with an open input and 112 pArms noise in the presence of 100 pF input capacitance, while at the 5 kHz bandwidth (typical in single-channel experiments) noise amounts to 0.45 pArms and 2.11 pArms, respectively. Using an optocoupler circuit producing TTL-controlled current impulses and using 50% threshold analysis we show that at full bandwidth the amplifier has deadtimes of 3.5 µs and 5 µs at signal-to-noise ratios(SNR) of 9 and 1.7, respectively. Near 100% of true current impulses longer than 5 µs and 6.6 µs are detected at these two respective SNRs, while false event detection rate remains acceptably low. The wide bandwidth of the amplifier was confirmed in bilayer experiments with alamethicin, for which open ion channel current events shorter that 10 µs could be resolved.,Science,voltage-clamp , temporal resolution , ion channels , electronic design ,https://github.com/Shlyonsky/OpenPicoAmp-100k,Other,No software,CC BY-SA,2020-02-26T00:00-05:00,

POSCAS is an adapted cold-frame that is normally used for gardening in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. The systems are parametric so they can be adapted for any size of PV module and designed to take advantage of distributed manufacturing. In addition, the thickness of the walls, type of wall insulation, possessing a floor or being directly located on the ground, the tilt angle of the module can all eb controlled by a parametric OpenSCAD script. The script outputs a 3-D printable file (STL) so the frame body can be manufactured from any waste plastic using distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM). POSCAS can both function as a traditional cold frame but it can also be automated with a temperature sensor, open source Arduino, fan and/or a motor to control air inflow into the greenhouse box. It can also be coupled to any number of other sensors to automate the care of the plants by controlling irrigation and fertilization. The PV module can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing, agricultural and power production. POSCAS can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV with thin film or crystalline silicon-based modules.  The percent transparency of the modules can be tested in a bank of POSCASs by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material, the various forms of optical enhancement and anti-reflection coatings or the density of silicon-based cells in the module. For example, they can be used to optimize Heliene greenhouse solar panels for specific crops.  Such Heliene red modules can have different transparencies by adjusting the density of the crystalline-silicon based cells. They are bifacial modules, which contain an energy-producing photovoltaic cells that generates electricity both from the top where the sunlight strikes it and from any reflection coming from underneath, and a red back-sheet. The back sheet transforms the green light spectrum into red before reaching the plants in the POSCAS below, while at the same time reflecting it back to the photovoltaic cell, which turns it into electricity that can be used in the greenhouse. The active materials that are in the back sheet can also be tested by the POSCAS (e.g. testing the density, size and chemical makeup of nanoparticles responsible for the solar light spectral shifting). All of these variables can be used to identify ideal PV designs for a given agricultural crop. This includes experimentally verifying the albedo from the crops and their impact on the different types of partially-transparent bifacial PV modules.,Agriculture,additive manufacturing; agriculture; agrivoltaic; distributed manufacturing; farming; gardening; open hardware; photovoltaic; recycling; solar energy ,https://osf.io/k6xwv/,CERN-OHL-P-2.0,No software,CC BY,2021-11-12T00:00-05:00,

It also integrates an ENC28J60 ethernet interface. Since the board uses the STM32F103, it is compatible with the Arduino IDE and most sketches written for boards like the BluePill.    Due to the layout of the board resembling a DIP-34 package, it can be experimented with in a breadboard, soldered into you own board, or just get plugged into a DIP socket.    Even though the board doesn't have many I/O pins, the most common interfaces, like USB,I2C,UART,SPI and CAN, are broken out. If you need more I/O pins, you can easily connect any port expander, like the PCF8574 to the board's I2C bus. The board itself requires a 3.3V power supply, but all broken out I/Os are 5V tolerant.,Electronics,STM32 , ENC28J60 , Ethernet , Arduino , IoT ,https://github.com/NetCube-Systems-Austria/STM32-Ethernet-Board,TAPR,No software,Other,2021-01-04T00:00-05:00,
